It took a little while but I'm really happy to be able to say that there is a
set of very good JS people around in the core issue queue. I know there are
some out there in contrib but unfortunately very few show up in the core
issue queue. We're nice and we have cookies, don't be afraid!

The short story is that back in february 2012, after writing [JavaScript
clean-up] [clean-up] patches for a few months, webchick told me on IRC that
she wouldn't have a problem with me stepping up as JS maintainer,
so [I did] [application]. Lacking people to review JS patches I approached
[seutje] [seutje] on [kristofvanroy] [kristofvanroy]'s recommendation. It
was at DrupalCon Munich — 3am,  at the bar — that I <del>conned</del> talked
seutje into being co-maintainer. Thanks to him, patches were reviewed,
more patches were written and I stopped being down about the lack of progress
 in JS.

Few months later, with new and fancy functionalities piling up in core — edit
module, the new toolbar, wysiwyg — and given my lack of interest for Backbone I
<del>coerced</del> asked nicely [jessebeach] [jessebeach] to be maintainer
with us since she appreciates the library and can walk the walk. We're pretty
much the [three musketeers of core javascript] [maint]. But we can't be the
three musketeers without the forth one: [Wim Leers] [wim]. Over time he's
been the one writing the most JS for core through his work on edit and wysiwyg.

I also want to give a shout out to [droplet] [droplet] who's been reminding us
that europe an north america are not the only Drupal users while sending out
really good patches. Thanks to [SebCorbin] [SebCorbin] for working on a major
and very [important architectural change] [explicitdeps]. Of course thanks
to: [mfer] [mfer], [ksenzee] [ksenzee], [JohnAlbin] [JohnAlbin],
[attiks] [attiks], [rupl] [rupl], [sdboyer] [sdboyer],
[rteijeiro] [rteijeiro] and everyone else working for a better JS in Drupal.
