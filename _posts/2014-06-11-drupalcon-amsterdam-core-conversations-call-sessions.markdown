DrupalCon Austin just wrapped up and if you want to discuss Drupal future in
Amsterdam, it's time to submit your core conversation session proposal. The
topic for core conversations is <strong>[Achieving sustainability]
[core]</strong>. There are [great proposals] [prop] already but not enough to
fill the whole track.

To expand a little on the topic of sustainability, Drupal is still the star
of the show but the context in which it is developed takes more importance as
Drupal codebase and our community grows. The most visible example is the
need for funding. Big initiatives need it: Views in core,
more recently Search API, Rules and core developers [would like to rely on
it] [gittip]. Funding is not the only topic we need to get a hard and
overdue look at though. Here are the ones we would like to have discussions on:

* Improving drupal.org (website, testbot, issue queue process)
* Funding core
* Performance and tracking data overtime
* Welcoming designers, UX professionals, and architects
* Behat/Frontend testing
* … and anything else you think is relevant!

This is a core <em>conversation</em> track, we can give ideas about what is
important — and this is by no mean the whole list — but more
than other tracks, it will be what you'll make of it.

Also note that there is one big change for core conversations in Amsterdam,
the deadline is <em>not</em> extended, June 13th midnight (Amsterdam
time!) is the deadline to <br><strong>submit your [session proposal]
[session]</strong>.
