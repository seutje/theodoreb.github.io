Those past few months have been very busy as you can see from my lack of
blogging since January. Three months ago I gave my notice to leave my job as
an Acquia technical consultant (3 months is the usual amount of time for
people with my kind of job in france). It was not easy to decide,
Acquia's [professional services team] [ps] is incredible and I'll miss working
with them (the team chat room is especially enjoyable :)

I needed a break from the crazy pace and unpredictable schedule, which are
perks until you want to have a life. Over the past two years I've travelled
to 40 cities in 19 countries. That took 263&nbsp;000km — mostly plane —
and a bit more than 300 days on the road. And during those trips I've learned
things about Drupal and management (or lack thereof) that can't be unlearned.
For a taste you can read [The things we found in your site] [found1] and
[part 2] [found2], it only talk about politically correct stuff though :)

Now that it's over, it's time for some light vacationing. I'm in Japan
pretty much until DrupalCon Amsterdam, if you're around Tokyo let me know.
The plan is to relax and enjoy not having to work all the time. After a few
weeks of that I'll be getting back to working on JS issues that are
outstanding, more on that in a follow-up post. After DrupalCon I'll be
working hard on [PillowTime] [pt] my pet project which is an online sleep
log aimed at people with sleep disorders, like me. The [too much
sleeping] [narco] kind for now, not the [can't get to sleep] [inso] kind yet.

Getting back to core work is fine and dandy but the problem of core funding
comes up once again. Fortunately before I left my old team and I worked out an
agreement that I'll be working with them on specific types of work. It helps
them clear their backlog and it helps me not having to hunt for clients,
so that I can spend more time contributing. The end result is that I'll be
able to sustain my work on core and I don't need to look for work to make
that possible.
